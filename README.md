# Credit Card Fraud Detection Model


This repository contains a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. The model is designed to predict whether a credit card transaction is normal or fraudulent based on a set of features extracted from the transaction.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing historical credit card transactions, where each transaction is labeled as either normal or fraudulent. The dataset used for training is not included in this repository due to privacy and licensing reasons.

## Model Details

The fraud detection model is built using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. The model uses a supervised learning algorithm to classify transactions as either normal or fraudulent based on the provided features.

The model is trained using the following features:
- V1 to V29: Numerical features extracted from the credit card transaction.
- Class: The binary target variable (0 for normal transaction, 1 for fraudulent transaction).

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The trained model is then saved using joblib and is available in the file 'credit_card_model'.

## Usage

To use the fraud detection model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (scikit-learn, joblib, etc.).
3. Load the model using `joblib.load('credit_card_model')`.
4. Prepare the input data with the necessary features (V1 to V29).
5. Use the `predict` method of the loaded model to predict the transaction's class (0 for normal, 1 for fraudulent).

Please note that the model's performance and accuracy may vary depending on the dataset used for training and the quality of the features.
